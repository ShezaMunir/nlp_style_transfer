# Bringing Back The Classics  
This project addresses the challenging task of text style transfer, first focusing on non-parallel data where equivalent sentences in different styles are not explicitly paired. Initially, the project fine-tunes the GPT-2 model with Jane Austen’s works to generate text in her authorial style, evaluated using BERTScore. To over- come the non-parallel nature of the data, an innovative approach is employed using Ope- nAI’s GPT-3.5-Turbo model for parallel text generation. This involves transforming Jane Austen’s text into modern English, facilitating effective style transfer models. The next step combines data from Project Gutenberg with augmented parallel data to enhance model per- formance, culminating in the development and evaluation of a BARTForConditionalGenera- tion model for bidirectional text style transfer. The evaluation strategy encompasses various metrics to gauge model efficacy in achieving seamless style transfer between classical and contemporary styles.
